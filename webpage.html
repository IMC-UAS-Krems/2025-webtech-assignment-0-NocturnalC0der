  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <h2>Adam here:</h2>
  <p>
    I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge on web development.
    Specifically, I am curious about how to make websites responsive. Also, I
    need to solidify my JS understanding, because I have a project in mind that
    I would like to build using React (would love to discuss that someday)
